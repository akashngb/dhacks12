Unless you’re a party of one - we had a person walk in and sit next to us\n\nFried cheese - waiter drizzled lemon juice and it sizzled nicely. But it cooled too quickly and became boring to eat\n\nBabaganoush - good but not the best in the city. I liked the pickled veggies that came with it though\n\nTzin spritz - ok, too much volume. I liked eating the berries.

The waiter packed the chicken for us\n\nFood not worth the $200 total, you are  paying for the ambience. Nice place to dress up for. Would be nice to just get drinks here also.

            "text": "Kokkari Estiatorio – A Taste of Greece in San Francisco\n\nI had a wonderful lunch at Kokkari Estiatorio, and it easily lived up to its stellar reputation. The ambiance strikes that perfect balance between elegant and inviting — rustic Mediterranean charm with a touch of modern sophistication.\n\nThe Greek salad was an absolute standout — fresh, vibrant, and beautifully balanced. Every bite tasted like it had just come from a garden, with crisp cucumbers, juicy tomatoes, and creamy feta that tied it all together.\n\nFor the main course, I ordered the lamb, and it was exceptional. Tender, perfectly seasoned, and full of rich, savory flavor — truly one of the best lamb dishes I’ve had in the city.\n\nTo finish, the Greek yogurt with honey made for a perfect dessert — light, creamy, and just sweet enough. It’s a generous portion, so I’d recommend sharing it (if you’re willing to part with a few bites!).\n\nOverall, Kokkari Estiatorio delivers a meal that feels both comforting and refined — a must-visit for anyone craving authentic Greek cuisine with a California touch. Highly recommended! 🇬🇷",
